# University project for the subject Computer Systems Administration

The case proposed in this project is that of a cluster formed by multiple machines running a Linux system.\
The task to be performed will be, therefore, to elaborate a set of scripts that will facilitate the administrator the configuration process of the whole system in a centralized way. \
In particular, the scripts will allow to carry out the configuration of storage devices, as well as the server and client parts of typical cluster services.

"configurar_cluster.sh" is the main script from which all the services are launched, such as raid
